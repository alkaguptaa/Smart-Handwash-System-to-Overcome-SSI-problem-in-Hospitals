# Smart-Handwash-System-to-Overcome-SSI-problem-in-Hospitals
To avoid Surgical Site Infections (S. S. I), it is vital to wash  hands adequately for at least 3 minutes using the World  Health Organization's standard guidelines. To guarantee adequate hand hygiene, the World Health  Organization has given six alternative hand washing routines.


The smart hand wash system will properly monitor hand 
positions in accordance with World Health Organization 
recommendations. With the help of deep learning and 
image processing, the camera module will scan the 
positions of the hands and match the exact positions with 
the fetched images in the code. If any of the users' or 
hospital staff's hand positions are not correctly recognized
or go wrong in any way, the buzzer will sound, alerting the 
user, and the image of the incorrect hand position will be 
placed in the database for proper monitoring and action.
